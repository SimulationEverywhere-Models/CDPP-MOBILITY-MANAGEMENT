I compiled the simulator in Cygwin using Linux environment.

The directory "Results" contains subdirectories for the tests on each of the atomic and coupled models. Each subdirectory contains all the necessary file to execute the test. Simply run demo.bat in each of the subdirectories and the results will be produced in the same subdirectory with the name output.out.

Note here the top model (Mobility Management) is in the sub-directory named MobilityManagement.
